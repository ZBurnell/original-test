# Bootcamp Project #1

## Description

This is my intro into programing. I started this webpage to learn how to code and as the first building block for my future career. It has shown me the importance of taking notes and how to trouble shoot issues when they arise.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

For now there is little that can be used within the webpage. It is filled with the few notes I've taken while developing it. As time goes on and I learn more it will be filled with notes about different topics(I.E HTML, CSS, JS and Git).
